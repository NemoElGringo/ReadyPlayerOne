# ReadyPlayerOne
This is a CTF challenge designed for beginners. To use it just run 
```console
$ docker compose up
```
 and connect to localhost on a browser, alternatively host it on your machine and have friends play it without the sources available!
## Spoilers ahead!
The main purpose of this challenge (aside from having fun) is to accustom the player with the idea that client side == bad.
